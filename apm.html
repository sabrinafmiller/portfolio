        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" >
          Let’s get down to business. The APM interview requires a great deal of prep, research, and failing. Yes, failing. And sometimes miserably. However, knowing that, you can be prepared on how to take lessons from these losses. Hopefully, I can help others learn from some of my mistakes and earn the coveted PM position. In this article I will talk about how APM interviews are structured, my advice, and a few resources that were invaluable to me.
  <br><br>
    The sequence of the APM interview usually goes along these lines: phone screen, product design/sense, product analysis/execution, and behavioral.
    <br><br>
    <b>Phone Screen:</b><br>
    The phone screen is typically a “feeler” interview with a recruiter or hiring manager. They will usually ask a few behavioral questions and inquire about your experience. The interviewer will also chat with you about the role and what they are looking for. The purpose of this interview is to determine a potential fit for the position and team.
    <br><br>
    <b>Product Design/Sense:</b><br>
    The product design portion of the interview is commonly conducted by someone on the PM team. This area of questioning will ask the interviewee to design or improve a product in some fashion. The key to cracking these questions is structure. This is the most important piece of advice that I can give. Most interviewers know that you are not an experienced PM, so what they are looking for is if you can answer complex questions by structuring your response into logical and digestible pieces. They want to see your thought process and if your reasoning is rational.
    <br><br>
    <b>Product Analysis/Execution:</b><br>
    These questions are designed to determine how you make decisions with or without data. Typically interviewers ask: “What and how would you measure the success of product (x)?” This ultimately leads to identifying metrics and how you would test them. Again, structure is your friend.
    <br><br>
    <b>Behavioral:</b><br>
    The fun part of the interview! This is where you can really connect and speak on your experiences to showcase your personality and your capabilities. They are looking for honesty and growth. How did you become better from this experience? I advise you to have 5-10 stories prepared that can really speak on your accomplishments, growth, and emotional intelligence.
    <br><br>
    <b>My Final Recommendations:</b><br>
    These are a few resources that were extremely helpful while beginning my product journey!<br><br>
    1) PM Masterclass on Udemy. If you are new to PM this is essential! This course teaches the ins and outs of product management and is instructed in simple/buildable terms. Pro tip: wait for a sale on Udemy. I got the course for $10.99 rather than $299.
    <br><br>
    2) The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen. This is a must and especially for analysis and execution. This book goes through everything you need to know about Lean Agile. 10/10 would recommend.
    <br><br>
    3) Decode and Conquer/Cracking the PM Interview. Everyone groups these together and I think they should almost be bought as a set. These are two different books, but both essential when interviewing for an APM or PM position. They help immensely with structuring answers and the PM interview process.
    <br><br>
    4) Lewis Lin PM Slack Chat: pminterview.slack.com. This is a Slack channel of PMs and aspiring PMs in which I used to mock with people while prepping for interviews. I strongly encourage this resource and recommend jumping out of your comfort zone to prep with like-minded people. While prepping for my interview with Facebook, I completed around 50 mocks with PMs and made some awesome networking connections.
    <br><br>
    5)Youtube videos. There is a large amount of PM mocks on Youtube in which I highly recommend to understand how other PMs structure their answers.
    <br><br>
    Happy Interviewing!
