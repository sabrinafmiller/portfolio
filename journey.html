          Almost every single interview you attend the interviewer will always ask you: why? Why this company? Why this position? Why did you choose to go down this path? Not until recently, did I actually sit down and deeply understand, “why do I want this and how will it help me grow?” It’s not that I lacked passion, because as you’ll read in my story below that is definitely not the case. It’s that I never understood what was fueling my passions and what had shaped them. Answering “my why” did not happen overnight and truthfully it’s still a work in progress, but it has helped me grow tremendously.<br><br>

Every person has life changing moments, whether you choose to recognize them or not. An event or string of events that brings new meaning to how you view the world around you. I recognize 3. 3 life changing experiences and lessons that formed into the pillars in which I am built on. These pillars are my why: empathy, love, and loss. <br><br>

Some people are born geniuses. Some people are born athletic. I was born with empathy. Some people call them empaths or highly sensitive people, but in reality it just means you feel and understand people much more deeply than others. I was the little girl who rooted for the villain in the movies because I believed they were often deeply misunderstood or had been cruelly mistreated causing them to behave in emotional outbreaks that they themselves did not understand, only because they desperately longed to be loved and accepted. I was 6 and this was about Jafar from Aladdin. It was a gift and a curse. As an empath, from an early age you are gifted with emotional intelligence that far surpasses the people around you, due to constant analyzing and scanning of reactions, body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, tendencies, etc... However, without putting action behind these emotions or having some sort of escape (mine was soccer), anxiety will almost definitely strike due to high over analyzation. After finishing my collegiate soccer career I lost my escape, and for the first time I was forced to put action behind these emotions instead of running from them. Within a few months, I left to Ecuador on a volunteer trip to build schools for the native children in the Amazon and also help fight for the clean water initiative. There are no words that can describe the hardships that these kids go through on a daily basis. This experience absolutely gutted me, but I found a sense of purpose. As an empath, my purpose is to help others through action not escape. Feeling and understanding people so deeply is no longer a curse but the fuel that ignites my passion.
<br><br>
As an empath, you often are so busy pouring into other people’s cups, you forget to leave any for your own. There is only so much from your own cup you can give until it’s bone dry. This metaphor is referring to love. This was common for me in particular, because the more I gave love the less I knew how to receive it, even from myself. Therefore 2018/2019 was declared a chapter of self love. A life changing moment. This meant learning how to accept love from myself and others. This meant taking the leap of faith and bridging the gap between my love for tech and my love for people, which ultimately led me to starting this blog and eventually breaking into product. This meant building projects and products for others that left me fulfilled. Products like the BLM Argument Guide application, in which I built to help aid racial conversations in the hopes to educate others with factual historical events and statistics. In honor of my Fiance, I hope to soon build a similar application that helps guide educated conversations about undocumented immigrants while also bringing attention to their struggles, again with the use of statistics. Products like my Covid-19 dashboard, although it may not have launched due to feasibility, I am still extremely proud of the effort I put into it and the validated learning I received from the experience! This was my first official side product in which I learned how to show myself love and acknowledge my efforts and pivots.
<br><br>
With loving others comes loss. This is the unfortunate price we pay for love. About 2 months ago I lost my best friend to his battle with depression. He was my first friend, my longest friend, my day 1 until the end. And with a ring of a phone call, the world stopped spinning - he was gone. It left me absolutely debilitated. As I began to pick up the pieces and bring meaning to all of this, I found that this life-altering event has again reshaped the way I think. It has made me yet again reevaluate what I envision for my future on a much more molecular level. <br><br>

So taking all this into consideration, <b>here is my why:</b>
Every single decision I make is a reflection of who I am, how my past has shaped me, and what I believe is important in that moment. Every single one. As I have just been reminded, tomorrow is not promised so every decision counts. That being said, I choose to use my purpose, my passions, and my talents for positive social change. I have a passion to build products because I understand people in ways that most people cannot. My passion is fueled by putting action to my purpose by creating products that promote human decency and a positive impact. And I will do this one calculated decision at a time. <br><br><br>
