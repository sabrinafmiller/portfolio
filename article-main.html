        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" >Growing up I had one idol. I only ever had one. Every night he would dance across the court, crafting his masterpiece onto the scoreboard using only but a leather sphere as his paintbrush. Kobe (Mamba) Bryant. My mother, a Mexican woman from East LA, grew up worshipping the Lakers with great influence from my Abuelos (grandparents). However once my mother was older, my Abuelos decided to move to an area with less crime that was about 99% white and away from the predominantly Spanish-speaking hub they once called home. In the hopes to fight being discriminated against in an all white town, my abuelita ordered the family to no longer speak Spanish in the effort to “fit in”.<br>

Fast forward many years... I too grew up in a predominantly white area. Even though I have tan skin and curly hair, my father is Caucasian and I have a last name that came with many more privileges than that of my mother’s and her upbringing. Nonetheless, I was still by and large raised by my Abuelos as a child, due to my parent’s demanding jobs and long hours. Yet this time around they spoke Spanish freely around the house. This time was different, because I did not have to deny my culture to assimilate like my mother. However, my mother is from East LA and full Mexican. I am from a white area and my last name is Miller… but raised in a Mexican household. Do you see the identity crisis here…?<br>

By no means was I the cool kid that got GoGurt and Fruit-Roll-Ups for lunch. I was the frizzy headed little girl with the chicharrones and bean burritos who also happened to be the best soccer player in school. Ohhh the stereotypes! However, since I understood Spanish but spoke very little, and my last name was blatantly unseasoned - I was often labeled as too white to be Mexican and too Mexican to be white.<br>

As you can tell, I am no stranger to the feeling of alienation and being “one of the few”. It has shaped me. But taking this a step further as to being a female in today’s society is a hardship all on its own. And furthermore, being a young underrepresented woman in a male dominated industry, when almost no one else either looks like you or understands you or your background, is nothing short of discouraging. Women professionals in the tech industry are warriors, constantly having to prove themselves while often in uncomfortable situations like stated above. Although unfortunate to endure, these uneasy experiences were valuable teaching moments and essential to my growth. In order to succeed in these environments, if anyone (male or female) is going to be sure of me, I had to become sure of myself and confident in my identity first.<br>

I understand that my struggles to self-acceptance do not compare to those less privileged than I. Furthermore, I empathize with the struggles of a Mexican girl forced to forget her culture and assimilate at a young age - my Mother. I empathize with the struggles of a Mexican woman that sacrificed her native language for the safety of her own children - my Abuelita. I empathize with the struggles of an undocumented Mexican man brought to the US as a little boy in hopes of a better future, only to be treated less than human - my Fiance. As I am growing into my culture, I am also fighting to protect theirs. <br>

As time moves on, naturally I have assimilated to the environment around me, however now I choose to do so on my own terms. I identify as a Mexican-American because I was raised in a Mexican and American household. I identify as a Latina because I am proud of who I am and I accept my culture and mixed upbringing. I will not forget the confused little Hispanic girl who eagerly watched Kobe in the efforts to emulate his confidence, learn how he repealed self doubt, and looked at other great icons without questioning who he was or his abilities. I will not forget that little girl. But with growth and self confidence, my idols have expanded to great Latina women who not only cherish their culture, but thrive because of it. Frida Kahlo. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sonia Sotomayor. Ellen Ochoa. I look to you.<br>
